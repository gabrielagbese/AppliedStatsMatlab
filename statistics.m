%Statistics question

% x = [a,b,c,d,e]
% X with dash at top is sample mean: mean()
% S^2 S^*2 is variance: var()
% S^* is standard deviation: std()
%Me is Median: median()
%Q1: quantile(x,0.25)
%Q3: quantile(x,0.75)

%Plot Empirical CDF: get the indexes of the values that x lies between, then divide it by the number of sample space n
